## Terms of Use

Flexible Roleplaying Framework is an app that allows the creation of deep, interactive roleplaying experiences over Discord.

You can contact me by Discord DM to @alli.

You're also invited to participate in the support Discord by submitting issues or feature requests. By doing so, you grant me an unrestricted, irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully-paid, worldwide license to use, copy, reproduce, distribute, sell, resell, publish, broadcast , retitle, store, publicly perform, publicy display, reformat, translate, excerpt (in whole or in part), and exploit your contributions for any purpose, commercial, advertising, or otherwise, to prepare derivative works of, or incorporate into other works, your contributions, and to sublicense the licenses granted in this paratgraph.

(In plain English: if you submit a feature request and I implement it later, I'll credit you with the idea, but you won't get the feature for free if I were to ever offer it as a premium add-on service).

You're invited to use this app without restriction, save for the following Prohibited Activities:

- No posting or submitting harassing, illegal, hateful, discriminatory, abusive, bullying, or bigoted content;
- No attempts to compile personal user data within the app;
- No disparagement towards the app or me;
- No false or spammy reports of abuse, misconduct, or application issues;
- No impersonation of other Discord users without their permission;
- No uploading or transmitting any malicious software that disrupts the service or users' use of the service, or any image or file that tracks a user's activity when viewed;
- No activity designed to overload the system.
- No use of this app as part of an effort to compete with what I'm providing, or as an attempt to generate your own revenue or further your own commercial enterprise.

If you believe someone is using this app to host your copyrighted data or links to your copyrighted data, please contact me with proof and I will review and takedown.

## Privacy Policy

I won't sell or share your data. I do store a number of things in a MySQL database to allow the bot to work, including user ID's, server ID's, and occasionally message ID's, but this is all linked to functionality of the bot, not stuff I'm keeping around to run metrics on or whatever. If you want to request all data from a given Discord server be removed, please contact me on Discord (@alli) with proof that you own the server in question. You can also contact me with any questions about this privacy policy!
